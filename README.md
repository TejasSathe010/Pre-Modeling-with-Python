# Pre-Modeling-with-Python

## Pre-Modeling: Data Preprocessing and Feature Exploration in Python
### Goal
- Goal:
 -1. Pre-modeling/modeling 80%/20% of work 
 -2. Show the importance of data preprocessing, feature exploration, and feature engineering on model performace
 -3. Go over a few effective pre-modeling steps
 -4. This is only a small subset of pre-modeling
- Format:
 -1. Tutorial style
 -2. Walk through concepts and code (and point out libraries)
 -3. Use an edited version of the 'adult' dataset (to predict income) with the objective of building a binary classification model
- Python libraries:
 -1. Numpy
 -2. Pandas
 -3. Sci-kit learn
 -4. Matplotlib
>Almost entire workflow is covered by these four libraries
Source of 'adult' dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
- Agenda
 -1. Modeling Overview
 -2. Introduce the Data
 -3. Basic Data Cleaning
 -4. Dealing with data types
 -5. Handling missing data
 -6. More Data Exploration
 -7. Outlier detection
 -8. Plotting distributions
 -9. Feature Engineering
 -10. Interactions between features
 -11. Dimensionality reduction using PCA
 -12. Feature Selection and Model Building
